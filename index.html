    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: April 15, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>DictationEasy is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use the DictationEasy mobile application ("App"). We prioritize your privacy by processing most data locally on your device and only sharing data with third parties when necessary, as described below.</p>

    <h2>Data We Process Locally</h2>
    <p>The App processes the following data locally on your device and does not transmit it over the internet unless specified otherwise:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> DictationEasy may request access to your camera to take photos for text extraction. These photos are processed locally on your device to extract text and are not stored or shared by the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> DictationEasy may request access to your photo library to scan images for text extraction. Selected images are processed locally on your device to extract text and are not stored or shared by the App.</li>
        <li><strong>File System Access:</strong> DictationEasy stores past dictations locally on your device in a secure, encrypted file to allow you to review and edit them later. This data is stored within the App’s sandboxed directory and is not shared with any third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Feedback Feature</h2>
    <p>The App includes a feedback feature that allows you to send us feedback via email. When you use this feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may enter feedback text, which is passed to your device’s email app (e.g., Apple Mail) using a <code>mailto:</code> link to send an email to <a href="mailto:dictationeasyapp@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dictationeasyapp@gmail.com</a>.</li>
        <li>The App itself does not store or transmit your feedback; however, when you send the email, your email app will transmit the feedback text and your email address to us over the internet.</li>
        <li>We may use your email address to respond to your feedback. We will not share your email address with third parties or use it for any other purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subscriptions and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>DictationEasy offers premium features through in-app subscriptions managed by the Apple App Store and RevenueCat, a third-party subscription management service.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> When you purchase a subscription, Apple processes your payment and collects data such as your Apple ID, payment information, and transaction history. This data is subject to Apple’s privacy policies. For more information, see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions within the App. RevenueCat may collect and process data such as a unique user identifier (App User ID), transaction data (e.g., subscription status, purchase history), device information (e.g., device type, iOS version), and IP address for subscription management, fraud prevention, and analytics purposes. This data is transmitted to RevenueCat’s servers over the internet. For more information, see <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li>The App itself does not store or process payment information; all payment-related data is handled by Apple and RevenueCat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>DictationEasy displays banner ads through Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) to support free features in the App.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AdMob Data Collection:</strong> AdMob may collect data such as device identifiers (e.g., IDFA if tracking is allowed), IP address, and ad interaction data (e.g., clicks, impressions) to serve ads and for analytics purposes. This data is transmitted to Google’s servers over the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>App Tracking Transparency (ATT):</strong> On iOS 14.5 and later, we request your permission to track your activity across apps and websites for personalized ads, as required by Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework. If you allow tracking, AdMob may use your device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) to serve personalized ads. If you deny tracking, AdMob will serve non-personalized ads, and the IDFA will not be accessed.</li>
        <li><strong>SKAdNetwork:</strong> We use Apple’s SKAdNetwork to attribute ad impressions and clicks without collecting personal data, ensuring privacy-friendly ad attribution.</li>
        <li>For more information on how Google handles ad-related data, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>DictationEasy is an educational app but is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 without parental supervision. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information (e.g., through the feedback feature), please contact us at <a href="mailto:dictationeasyapp@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dictationeasyapp@gmail.com</a>, and we will promptly delete such information.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We handle data retention and deletion as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Data processed locally on your device (e.g., photos, dictations) is stored until you delete it or uninstall the App. Uninstalling the App will remove all locally stored data.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Emails:</strong> If you send us feedback via email, we retain your email address and feedback text only as long as necessary to respond to your inquiry. Once resolved, we delete the email unless required to retain it for legal purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Data:</strong> Data collected by third parties (e.g., RevenueCat, AdMob) is subject to their retention policies. You can manage your subscription data through the Apple App Store, and you can opt out of personalized ads via the ATT prompt or your device’s privacy settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion Requests:</strong> If you wish to request deletion of any data we hold (e.g., feedback emails), please contact us at <a href="mailto:dictationeasyapp@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dictationeasyapp@gmail.com</a>. For data held by third parties, you can contact them directly using the links provided above.</li>
    </ul>
