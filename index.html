    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: April 15, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>DictationEasy is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the DictationEasy mobile application ("App").</p>

    <h2>Data We Process Locally</h2>
    <p>The App processes the following data locally on your device and does not transmit it over the internet unless specified otherwise:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> DictationEasy may request access to your camera to take photos for text extraction. These photos are processed locally on your device to extract text and are not stored or shared by the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> DictationEasy may request access to your photo library to allow you to select images for text extraction. Selected images are processed locally on your device to extract text and are not stored or shared by the App.</li>
        <li><strong>File System Access:</strong> DictationEasy stores past dictations locally on your device in a secure, encrypted file to allow you to review and edit them later. This data is stored within the App’s sandboxed directory and is not shared with any third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Feedback Feature</h2>
    <p>The App includes a feedback feature that allows you to send us feedback via email. When you use this feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may enter feedback text, which is passed to your device’s email app (e.g., Apple Mail) using a <code>mailto:</code> link to send an email to <a href="mailto:dictationeasyapp@gmail.com">dictationeasyapp@gmail.com</a>.</li>
        <li>The App itself does not store or transmit your feedback; however, when you send the email, your email app will transmit the feedback text and your email address to us over the internet.</li>
        <li>We may use your email address to respond to your feedback. We will not share your email address with third parties or use it for any other purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subscriptions and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>DictationEasy offers premium features through in-app subscriptions managed by the Apple App Store and RevenueCat, a third-party subscription management service.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> When you purchase a subscription, Apple processes your payment and collects data such as your Apple ID, payment information, and transaction history. This data is subject to Apple’s privacy policies. For more information, see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions within the App. RevenueCat may collect and process data such as a unique user identifier (App User ID), transaction data (e.g., subscription status, purchase history), device information (e.g., device type, iOS version), and IP address for subscription management, fraud prevention, and analytics purposes. This data is transmitted to RevenueCat’s servers over the internet. For more information, see <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank">RevenueCat’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li>The App itself does not store or process payment information; all payment-related data is handled by Apple and RevenueCat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hosting on GitHub Pages</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect certain data from visitors to this page, such as IP addresses, for security purposes.
